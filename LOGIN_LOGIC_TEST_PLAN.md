# 🧪 Login Logic Test Plan

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

The login logic has been **correctly implemented** and includes:

### 1. **Proper Username Lookup**
- Uses Supabase query: `.eq("username", username).single()`
- Correctly handles PGRST116 error (no rows found)
- Searches by username, not full name

### 2. **Correct Routing Logic**
- **Existing members** → `/frontdoor` with username parameter
- **New members** → `/signup` with first, last, username parameters
- **Database errors** → Show alert, no routing

### 3. **Signup Validation**
- Checks username availability before insert
- Prevents duplicate username creation
- Handles race conditions with database constraints

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added comprehensive console logging with emojis
- Tracks all login attempts and outcomes
- Easy debugging with clear success/error indicators

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Existing Member (Robert Paulson)
**Input:** `Robert Paulson`
**Expected Username:** `RobertP`
**Expected Result:** 
- Console: `✅ EXISTING MEMBER: Found member "RobertP" (ID: X) - routing to frontdoor`
- Route: `/frontdoor` with `{ username: "RobertP" }`

### Test 2: New Member
**Input:** `John Doe`
**Expected Username:** `JohnD`
**Expected Result:**
- Console: `✅ NEW MEMBER: No existing member found with username "JohnD" - routing to signup`
- Route: `/signup` with `{ first: "John", last: "Doe", username: "JohnD" }`

### Test 3: Signup Process
**After Test 2, complete signup form:**
- Address: `123 Test St`
- Phone: `555-123-4567`
- Password: `testpass`
**Expected Result:**
- Console: `✅ SIGNUP SUCCESS: Member "JohnD" created successfully`
- Route: `/frontdoor` with `{ username: "JohnD" }`

### Test 4: Duplicate Username Prevention
**Try to signup with existing username:**
**Expected Result:**
- Console: `❌ SIGNUP ERROR: Username "RobertP" is already taken`
- Alert: "Username Taken" message

## 🔍 How to Test

1. **Start the app:** `npx expo start --clear`
2. **Open browser console** to see logging output
3. **Navigate to login screen**
4. **Test each scenario** by entering the names above
5. **Verify console logs** match expected output
6. **Verify routing** works correctly

## 📋 Expected Console Output

### Successful Login (Existing Member)
```
🔍 LOGIN: Looking up username "RobertP" for "Robert Paulson"
✅ EXISTING MEMBER: Found member "RobertP" (ID: 1) - routing to frontdoor
```

### New Member Signup
```
🔍 LOGIN: Looking up username "JohnD" for "John Doe"
✅ NEW MEMBER: No existing member found with username "JohnD" - routing to signup
🔍 SIGNUP: Checking if username "JohnD" is available
✅ SIGNUP: Username "JohnD" is available - proceeding with signup
✅ SIGNUP SUCCESS: Member "JohnD" created successfully
```

### Error Cases
```
❌ DATABASE ERROR: [error details]
❌ SIGNUP ERROR: Username "RobertP" is already taken
❌ UNEXPECTED ERROR during login: [error details]
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Login with "Robert Paulson" routes to frontdoor
- [ ] Login with new name routes to signup
- [ ] Signup form completes successfully
- [ ] Duplicate username prevention works
- [ ] Console logging shows correct messages
- [ ] No routing loops or infinite redirects
- [ ] Error handling shows user-friendly messages

## 🎯 Conclusion

The login logic is **already correctly implemented** and should work as expected. The enhanced logging will help verify the correct execution path for each scenario.
