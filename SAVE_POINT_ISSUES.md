# Pizza Club - Current Issues Save Point

## üéØ **Issues to Address Tomorrow**

### **1. Login Flow Issue (Still Broken)**
**Problem:** Existing members (like Robert Paulson) still go to signup form instead of frontdoor
**Last Attempt:** Fixed login.tsx to lookup by username instead of first_name + last_name
**Status:** Still not working - needs further investigation

**Next Steps:**
- Debug why username lookup is failing
- Check if RLS policies are blocking the query
- Verify the actual username format in database vs generated username
- Test with console logs to see what's happening

### **2. Previous Fixes (Working)**
‚úÖ **Profile Updates** - Fixed PGRST116 error, now uses username for updates
‚úÖ **Duplicate Username Prevention** - Signup now checks for existing usernames
‚úÖ **RLS Policy Cleanup** - Reduced from 7 to 3 clean policies
‚úÖ **UI State Management** - Fixed "Saving..." stuck states
‚úÖ **Menu Page Polish** - Improved pizza card styling and responsiveness

### **3. Files Modified Today**
- `app/login.tsx` - Fixed member lookup logic (may need more work)
- `app/signup.tsx` - Added username uniqueness check
- `app/account.tsx` - Fixed profile update logic and error handling
- `app/menu.tsx` - Enhanced styling and responsiveness
- `supabase_rls_cleanup_fixed.sql` - RLS policy cleanup
- `fix_account_update_rls.sql` - Account update RLS fix
- `final_rls_cleanup.sql` - Final policy consolidation

### **4. Debugging Steps for Tomorrow**
1. Check what username is actually stored for "Robert Paulson" in database
2. Compare with what login.tsx generates ("RobertP")
3. Test the Supabase query directly in SQL editor
4. Check RLS policies are allowing the SELECT query
5. Add more detailed console logging to see exact error

### **5. Test Cases**
- [ ] Login as "Robert Paulson" ‚Üí should go to frontdoor
- [ ] Login as new user ‚Üí should go to signup
- [ ] Profile editing ‚Üí should work (already fixed)
- [ ] Signup with duplicate username ‚Üí should show error (already fixed)

## üîß **Quick Start Tomorrow**
1. Run `npx expo start` to start the app
2. Test login with "Robert Paulson"
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Debug the username lookup issue

Good luck tomorrow! üçï‚ú®
